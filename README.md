## Introduction

Welcome to the Moove project! This repository contains the implementation of a decentralized platform for the sale and management of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) specifically tailored for Moove, a company providing shared micro-mobility services in various European cities. Moove aims to enhance its shared mobility experience by leveraging NFTs to manage its fleet of vehicles.

## About my choice

I chose to split the project into two folders:

### Contracts folder

### Frontend folder

## Installation

## About testing

## About deployment

**_Before running the "npx hardhat compile"_**
